                <h2>How Swiss Roll Was Born</h2>
                <p>It started with a bad joke at a café in Plainpalais.</p>
                
                <p>"You know what Geneva needs?" said Dr. Sophie Mercier to her colleague over coffee. "A physio clinic that doesn't feel like a hospital. Somewhere people actually want to go."</p>
                
                <p>"Like a bakery?" joked Dr. Antoine Dubois.</p>
                
                <p>"Exactly like a bakery. But instead of pastries, we roll out your pain."</p>
                
                <p>They laughed. Then they looked at each other. Then they stopped laughing and started planning.</p>
                
                <p>Three months later, Swiss Roll Physio opened its doors. The name stuck. The concept worked. Patients loved it. Even the serious ones.</p>
                
                <p>Today, we're Geneva's favorite physiotherapy clinic (self-proclaimed, but also backed by actual patient reviews and several Google stars). We combine world-class treatment with a sense of humor, because healing shouldn't be grim.</p>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>🎯 Precision</h3>
                    <p>We're Swiss. Precision is in our DNA. Every treatment is carefully planned and executed. Like a watch movement, but squishier.</p>

                    <h3>😊 Humor</h3>
                    <p>Pain is serious. Treatment doesn't have to be grim. We believe laughter helps healing. (It's not FDA approved, but we're in Switzerland, so WHO approved?)</p>

                    <p>You're not just a spine or a knee. You're a whole person. We treat the problem AND help you prevent future ones. Prevention beats cure, even if cure is our business.</p>
